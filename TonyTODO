buffered iterator?

read struct: for fastQ, for fastA.

count number of reads - every 4 lines
	indexing iterator (return positions in underlying iterator)
	and get the counts

iterator with element type of iterator (for fasta?)

iterator with element type of reads.
	internal to reads are 2 ptrs/iterators
	

(
iterator of iterator? with delimiter
	internal iterator has a delimiter for termination
		== search in outer iterator during the ++ phase.
	outer iterator uses a different delimiter
	internal pointers of both are incremented together
)
	

assign read ids. (prefix scan)

create kmers and reverse complement - abyss idea is not bad

create quality score and reverse complement quality score

mpi redistribution code.

spaced seeds?
